## Mobile version

### Design choice
The choice for bitcoin was inspired by an open source that I've been following the development of. 

The color choice was chosen based on the typical color for coins, id est yellow. However, as I didn't want it to be plain and boring I decided to create a gradient, and thought of a color that mixed well with yellow but still at the same time gave warmth to the user interface and therefore I chose red.
I experimented with the positioning of the gradient endpoints and decided to put the yellow color on top and the red on the bottom. 

The background of the user interface was inspired by the use of circuits when googling bitcoins. The opacity of the circuit was adjusted to 50% and I thought that was reasonable, since I didn't want it to be too prominent.

The Login form follows the standard for mobiles, where you have one field for the username (Email also works) and one for the password. The element "Forgot your password" seems to be very common and thus I added it. In addition to that, "Don't have an account? Sign up here" seems to also be very common to have in a login form. I didn't include it because I thought sign up with was sufficient. 



### What have I learned

I learned the standard elements of login forms for mobile versions, which are: 

* A field for the username
* A field for the password
* A login button 
* Sign up with facebook, twitter or google+
* Text that says "Forgot your password?" and "Don't have an account? Sign up here"
