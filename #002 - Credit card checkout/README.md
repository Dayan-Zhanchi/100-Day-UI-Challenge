## Design choice
I was initially looking for something minimalistic and with predominantly white color as the background sprinkled in with some few other colors for the text or other small elements in the picture. Ended up with coloring the background to the theme of the item, a lemonade drink. The separator is not optimal, and I couldn't find a way to color the background with the help of the separator, it doesn't seem like Figma has a support for that, so I colored the entire background uniformly with the same color. The checkout price could have been made smaller and not been placed in the middle, and instead having the item placed in the middle to grab the attention of the user.

## What have I learned
The standard elements for a credit card checkout e.g:
* Credit card type
* Name
* Credit card number
* CCV
* Expiration date for the credit card
<br/>
Also some other things such as the different fields for the prices:
<br/>
* Taxes
* Shipping price
* Price of items
* Total price

<br/> 
Furthermore, it seems important to place it in a conspicuous position since it's supposed to be the main element. As such, I think that the UI I created have some room for improvements.
